## 2. Structural Anti-Patterns

### Rule of Threes
AI defaults to listing exactly three items. Vary to two, four, or five.

❌ `innovative, transformative, and groundbreaking`
✅ `innovative and genuinely new`

### False Ranges
Implies a spectrum where none meaningfully exists.

❌ `From intimate gatherings to global movements`
✅ State the actual scope directly

### Compulsive Summaries
AI reflexively adds "In summary", "In conclusion", "Overall" even in short texts.

❌ `In summary, this approach offers three key benefits...`
✅ End on a point, not a recap

### Negative Parallelism / Corrective Antithesis
❌ `It's not just about X — it's about Y`
❌ `Not X. But Y.`
❌ `Not only X but also Y`
✅ Make the positive statement directly

### Avoidance of Simple Copulatives
AI avoids "is/are" in favor of elaborate substitutes.

❌ `This tool represents a significant advancement`
✅ `This tool is a significant step forward`

### Cookie-Cutter Paragraph Length
Every paragraph runs to exactly 3-4 sentences. Vary intentionally.

### Staccato on Repeat
Endless short sentences with no variation in rhythm.

❌ `X is important. Y matters too. Z helps a lot. We use all three.`
✅ Mix short punchy lines with longer, flowing ones

### Gift-Wrapped Endings
AI ends pieces by restating key points and adding "moving forward" or "going forward".

❌ `Moving forward, organizations that adopt this approach will...`
✅ End on a concrete point, observation, or open question

## 3. Transition Word Overuse

These connectives appear at abnormally high rates in AI text:

**Opening sentences:**
- Additionally (especially at sentence start)
- Furthermore
- Moreover
- In today's fast-paced [world/landscape/environment]...
- In a world where...
- As [industry] continues to evolve...

**Mid-text pivots:**
- However (fine in moderation, flagged when every paragraph uses it)
- On the other hand
- It is worth noting that
- Importantly
- Notably

**Closing pivots:**
- In summary
- In conclusion
- Overall
- To summarize
- Going forward / Moving forward

**Fix:** Use contextual transitions, or none. Let the logic do the connecting.

## 4. Promotional & Tourism-Brochure Language

These phrases appear frequently in AI content about places, products, and people:

- "stands as a testament to"
- "rich cultural heritage"
- "enduring legacy"
- "marks a pivotal moment"
- "breathtaking [views/scenery/results]"
- "nestled within"
- "a hub of innovation"
- "a melting pot of"
- "vibrant community"
- "steeped in history"

**Fix:** Describe specifically. "The old quarter has cobblestone streets built in the 14th century" beats "a historic district with rich cultural heritage."

---

## 5. Faux-Conversational Openers & Pivots

AI mimics human conversational style with formulaic phrases:

**Openers:**
- "Let's dive in"
- "Let's break it down"
- "Let's unpack"
- "Let's face it"
- "But let's get real"
- "It's no secret that"

**Pivots:**
- "But here's the thing"
- "Here's the catch"
- "But here's the bind"
- "What does this mean for you?"
- "This is where [X] really shines"

**Fix:** Start with the substance. Skip the theatrical wind-up.

---

## 6. Hedge Word Clusters

AI stacks qualifiers to avoid commitment:

❌ `This approach might perhaps generally be considered somewhat useful`
✅ Pick a position: `This approach works well for X`

**Common hedges to audit:**
- might, could, may, perhaps, possibly
- generally, typically, often, usually
- somewhat, relatively, fairly, quite

One hedge per claim is fine. Stacking them signals AI.

---

## 7. Formatting Overkill

- **Excessive bold** on random phrases mid-sentence
- Bullet lists for content that flows naturally as prose
- Headers for every 2-3 sentences
- Emoji in section headers (🚀 Key Takeaways)
- Numbered lists when order doesn't matter

**Fix:** Use formatting to serve the reader, not to appear thorough.

---

## 8. Em Dash Misuse

AI overuses em dashes to insert asides and fake emphasis.

❌ `The tool — which was launched last year — provides — among other things — a dashboard`
✅ `The tool, launched last year, includes a dashboard`

Also: AI often uses hyphens for number ranges instead of en dashes (5-10 vs 5–10). Small but detectable.

---

## 9. Passive Voice Dominance

AI defaults to passive to sound formal and neutral.

❌ `The report was compiled by researchers at the university`
✅ `University researchers compiled the report`

Use passive when the actor is unknown or irrelevant. Otherwise, active.

---

## 10. SEO-Specific AI Patterns

### Keyword Stuffing in Headers
❌ `Best Project Management Software for Remote Teams in 2024`
✅ `How Remote Teams Actually Pick Project Management Tools`

### Meta Description Boilerplate
❌ `Discover the comprehensive guide to [keyword]. Learn everything you need to know about [keyword] and how [keyword] can help your business.`
✅ Write it like a human telling a friend what the page covers

### Listicle Padding
AI pads list posts with thin items to hit a number ("17 Ways to…"). Cut weak items, keep strong ones.

### Intro Paragraph Formulas
❌ `In today's competitive landscape, businesses are increasingly turning to [topic] to gain a strategic advantage.`
✅ Open with a concrete fact, question, or scene

## Detection Notes (from Wikipedia editors)

- Many of these patterns appear in human writing too — they are **indicators, not proof**
- Context matters: a tourism brochure can use "breathtaking" without being AI-generated
- Newer AI models are learning to avoid known tells — detection evolves
- The strongest signal is **pattern clustering**: one indicator is nothing, five in a paragraph is suspicious
